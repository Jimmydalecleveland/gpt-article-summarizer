# Article Summarizer for Jimmy Cleveland's blog

## This repo is nothing special
I'm creating this purely as practice while looking at other people's projects to
see if there is anything I'm missing. It is just your standard API call to openai
that summarizes some content.

This could definitely be used for any articles, I'm just keeping it specific for 
the sake of simplicity.

### To run locally
You will need a `.env.local` with the openai API key. See the `.env.example`.

```bash
npm run dev
```
